# Task

Implement reliable transport protocol using Selective Repeat in C by studying and extending an implmentation of Go Back N running on a network simulator.

# Background

You've been hired by "Net Source", a company specialising in networking software to build Selective Repeat code for their network emulation tool. They have an existing implementation of Go-Back-N that interfaces with their emulator. Their programmer, Mue, who was working on an implementation of the Selective Repeat protocol has caught the flu and the implementation must absolutely be finished in the next week.  As the code isn't finished, Mue hasn't completed testing yet. Mue is an experienced C programmer and there is nothing wrong with the C syntax or structure of the code that Mue has written. So you don't have to correct any C syntax errors, your job is to finish the code, correct any protocol errors and test it. 

Although you are not required to use this code, they expect much of this code is reusable and only some modifications are needed to change Go-Back-N to Selective Repeat. Your boss realises you're not a C expert, but at least you've programmed in Java or C++ before so you're the closest they have as an expert. Their last C programmer has written a C hints for Java and C++ programmers sheet which explains what you need to know about C that is different than Java and C++. She's confident that if you stick to the sheet, anything else you need to add or change would be the same if you wrote it in Java or C++.
